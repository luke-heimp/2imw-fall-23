                    The interaction element selected for me was the idea of drag. After doing some research and looking at the examples provided I decided on making an interaction based on horizontal dragging. My plan was to simulate depth by using a multilayered stack of images which would each interact differently when dragged. The dragging would see a little car take a journey through scenery. The effect was meant to emulate the parallax seen in animated films and video games. I liked this idea, but after speaking with Peter I came to the understanding that it didnâ€™t take full advantage of the idea of dragging. This project would have been more suited to scrolling. So it was back to the drawing board.

                  <p>	After more research and consideration I came up with a new focus for my drag interaction. I wanted to create an experience where a viewer could drag blocks around and stack them. To accomplish this I researched different physics engines that work with javascript. I found one called Matter.JS. I followed many little tutorials and made experimental projects to learn the software. </p>
                  <a href="2/index.html"><p>Matter.js experiment 1</p></a> </li>
                  <a href="3/index.html"><p>Matter.js experiment 2</p></a> </li>
                  <a href="4/index.html"><p>Matter.js experiment 3</p></a> </li>
                  <p>
                    My experiments helped me come to grips with this challenging engine. A Matter.js feature that I really enjoyed playing with was called Stack. Stack allows the user to define a polygon and continually stack it in a rectangle of any dimensions. I had so much fun playing with the interaction of stack with the physics of the engine that I decided to focus my project on destroying and dragging the elements of a stack.
                    I built a narrative around the idea that a kitchen table is full of dirt that must be swept away. Sweeping is a real-world form of dragging so it translates well into a digital form. I also designed surfaces for the dirt stack to collide with (a turkey, a bottle of wine, and a gravy boat). The environment is also interactive with the dirt physics. I designed the kitchen background and all of the assets using Illustrator and mapped them as sprites onto my physics objects. The result is a lighthearted game that uses full advantage of the drag interaction.
                    I learned a lot from the process of integrating an engine into my project. The process saw a lot of trial and error, but in the end, I was able to make it all work.
