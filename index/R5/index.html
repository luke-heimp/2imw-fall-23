    <h2>R5: My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge</h2>
    <p>
      1. I agree with Laurel Schwulst’s assertion that individual websites are
      more effective than social media. Social media websites exist within the
      attention economy. They do not exist for self-expression and connection,
      but rather as a means for advisors to show people ads. The concept of
      expressing yourself within social media’s confines only exists to keep
      users trapped on web pages so large companies can show advertisements. In
      contrast, individual websites exist as a unique means of self-expression,
      especially for artists. People can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make
      anything imaginable to share their personalities with the world. This
      freedom is infinite compared to the increasingly standardized world of
      social media boxes. Individual websites can build unique and engaging
      interactions and user experiences. Individuals with their own websites can
      create work that exists on its own. This isolation gives their content
      more importance as opposed to it being one of a billion pages fighting for
      the user’s attention. Individual websites can set the record straight with
      more freedom of expression and creative possibilities to express oneself.
      With individual websites creators can own 100% of what they host without
      relying on middlemen. People aren't boxes so we should not box them in,
      that’s why design flexibility and freedom are so important. One
      consideration not mentioned in the article is that personal websites are
      great, but they exist in an isolated ecosystem, making them far more
      difficult for people to find as opposed to the large deliberately
      interconnected webs of social media platforms.<br /><br />
      2. Website as snowman A snowman is a human creation existing as a form of
      creative expression. Snowmen are made out of common materials available to
      many people, but only a certain few go through the effort of getting
      bundled up and making them. Snowmen exist as representations of people
      despite obviously not having life themselves. Based on a snowman’s
      appearance people ascribe it a personality and meaning. A snowman is never
      complete, it can always be changed. The appearance of a snowman is in
      flux, it can be altered, therefore changing its personality. Some people
      build snowmen for the joy of creation, while others build snowmen as
      public exhibitions. In spite of their novelty, snowmen can be used as a
      tool for communication. The conditions to build a snowman must be right,
      they cannot be rushed. When the weather changes snowmen disappear. Without
      the favourable hosting of wet winter snow, the ephemeral creation fades
      away never to be seen again.
