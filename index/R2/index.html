    <h2>R2: What Screens Want</h2>
    <p>
      1. Chimero argues that we should reevaluate how we use screens. He says to
      not be complacent we must change our interactions with screens to reflect
      what we actually want and what is actually useful. Instead of focusing on
      how elements appear on our screens, Chimero argues that their behaviour is
      far more important. Skeomorphs and metaphors are effective, but their
      interactions and flux-based behaviour are what make them useful and
      understandable to the computer user. The potential of screens to
      noninvasively improve our lives is not being met. Screens should make our
      lives easier by making tasks more straightforward and efficient in ways
      traditional tools cannot. Screens have amalgamated many of the traditional
      tools we use, but the inherent simplicity of those tools has been lost.
      The way we learn, understand, and execute web design is built using a map
      designed for profit and attention. This needs to change. To bring what
      screens want in line with what we actually want a new vocabulary must be
      created. Designers and professionals need a better way to communicate
      about web design and its potential for useful behaviours. This new
      outlook, vocabulary, and focus on the behavioural dynamism of the screen
      medium will allow for a reinvention of our relationships with the screen
      and the web. <br /><br />22. Like Chimero I think the focus shouldn’t be
      on the debate between flat and skeuo. Instead of debating the superfluous
      recreation of the real world or excessive simplification, a balance must
      be struck. Flux-based behaviour should be the focus. The usefulness of
      high skeuomorphism falls away after one becomes very familiar with how
      digital tools work. While flat representation can be alienating to many
      due to its abstraction. Computers can present interactive moving images
      with logical and useful behaviours programmed in. These behaviours appeal
      to the real-world logic of skeuomorphism while engaging in the
      screen-based simplicity of flat design. When things behave in logical and
      useful ways the design becomes invisible and unobtrusive. Google Maps is
      an excellent amalgamation of skeuomorphism, flat design, and dynamic
      logical behaviour. The interface is completely flat with icons
      representing real-world pins. When a user zooms in and out the program
      automatically adds and removes details about roads and places to create a
      less hectic, more enjoyable user experience. The entire system is based on
      the idea that the more a user zooms in on a location the more detailed
      information displayed will become. To orient the user in space Google Maps
      automatically places a ‘you are here’ marker with a representation of the
      user’s field of view on its map. This use of technology is so important
      because it responds to the viewer’s real-world inputs in a completely
      logical way. This balance of visual information (flat and skeuo) and
      adaptive behaviour is almost invisible because of how much sense it makes
      to the user's understanding of space, streamlining their use of the
      program to find the information they desire. <br /><br />
      3. The zoopraxiscope is a device created by Eadweard Muybridge to animate
      and display his sequential images. The device was a flat circle made of
      glass with Muybridge’s second-splitting photography printed radially along
      the outside. When light was shone through the spinning invention it would
      cast a moving silhouette of the photographs onto a flat surface. This
      device marked the beginning of a long tradition of using light to display
      moving images on a screen. The technology has changed drastically, but the
      concept of harnessing light to playback dynamic imagery survives to this
      day in many forms. Muybrdige’s invention relates to contemporary web and
      interaction design because it created the form for movement to be recorded
      and played back to a viewer using light and a screen. The movements of
      web-based interaction are all made up of hundreds of individual images
      displayed on a screen in rapid succession, a direct evolution of
      Muybridge's horses on his zoopraxiscope. Much of the design and vocabulary
      surrounding digital design and screen-based technology comes directly from
      cinema. It is no coincidence that the screens we use on an everyday basis
      are the shape that they are. The oblong rectangle of the cinematic screen
      has been replicated on a smaller scale in televisions, computer monitors,
      and sideways cell phones. We have built operating systems, software, and
      websites to fill this specific shape because computer screens descend from
      cinematic screens and the precedent set by Muybridge.
