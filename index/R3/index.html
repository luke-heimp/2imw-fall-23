    <h2>R3: Interface and Interpretation</h2>
    <p>
      1. Drucker defines an interface as a dynamic space and system in which a
      subject is invoked. Interfaces are interactive richly networked portals
      designed for organizing activities, behaviours, and activities. Interfaces
      are visual forms of knowledge production. An interface is not simply what
      we read, but how we read and engage. The design of an interface involves
      creating a streamlined environment for the subject to achieve their goals.
      This transparent environment calls to attention its madeness. This
      transparency informs how a subject invokes the interface. Aside from
      streamlined transparency designers must also consider aesthetics and the
      diverse possible desires of different subjects. An interface is not a
      natural thing, but a deliberately designed system for humans to organize
      themselves and their knowledge. Drucker argues that today, our engagement
      with the interface as a compositional mode lags behind. Designers should
      prioritize dynamic subject interaction and the aesthetic value of an
      interface rather than pure functionality. When I read this chapter I
      thought of Microsoft’s new Windows 10 interface design. The interface of
      the entire operating system involves large fields of coloured squares. The
      design is functional, but it's ugly, flat, and actually quite unintuitive
      in its starkness. The Microsoft designers struck a much better balance of
      aesthetics and usefulness in the interface design of Windows 11.
      <br /><br />
      2. Drucker evokes the idea of humanistic design as a means to make
      interface design more meaningful for more people. A humanistic interface
      is an interface designed to resonate with all people of all cultures and
      all technological literacy levels. These well-designed spaces allow a
      subject to orient themselves in data and “support … question, analysis,
      and study” (Drucker). Humanistic interfaces eschew sole functionality in
      favour of an aesthetically considered and meaningful environment for
      individual contemplation. Humans are all different and will approach an
      interface with different skills, biases, and intentions. There is no
      singular ‘user experience’. Humanist design embraces this ambiguity. The
      interface is a digital space for inconsistent subjects to be able to
      interpret similar information. A humanist interface holds the subject's
      hand as it guides them along the journey of information all the while
      treating them with empathy and respecting their individuality. A
      humanistic interface is built with “imaginative vision mak[ing the]
      interface a space of being and dwelling, not a realm of control panels and
      instruments” (152).<br /><br />
      3. As I read this article I found that the writing was quite theoretical
      and very aspirational. As much as this information was important and
      interesting I was missing some concrete practicality. When Drucker
      discussed humanistic design I was waiting for information about
      accessibility. This never came. I found this surprising because I believe
      accessibility is a central tenet of humanistic design. I would have
      appreciated an analysis of the tools available to make interfaces more
      accessible to more people (i.e. changing font sizes, colourblind options,
      built-in readers). I worked as a graphic designer for a government
      organization and was required to follow very specific accessibility rules.
      I would have liked to learn more about how these rules apply to designing
      humanistic interfaces. The chapter talks at length about the importance of
      humanistic interface design, but it rarely explores how an interface could
      be designed to aid different people. I believe Drucker’s chapter lacks
      essential information about designing across cultures. How can interfaces
      serve different cultures with different notions of space, information,
      writing, and hierarchy? This practical and less theoretical information
      would have vastly improved my reading experience and the usefulness of the
      chapter.
