                      The celebration of Canada’s anniversary in 2017 is also a moment for reflection: “What comes after the environment?” will feature a discussion between award-winning author, filmmaker, and climate-change activist Naomi Klein and architect, curator, and director of the Canadian Centre for Architecture Mirko Zardini, whose forthcoming book and exhibition It’s all happening so fast – A Counter-History of the Modern Canadian Environment explores Canada’s conflicted and conflicting views of what we call the “natural environment”.
