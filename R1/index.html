    <h2>R1: A Handmade Web</h2>
    <p>
      1. In her article, A Handmade Web J. R. Carpenter explores the importance
      of "web pages made and maintained by individuals” (Carpenter). The thesis
      of the piece is that individual handmade creativity and expression are
      limited on the modern web as it is full of commercial, proprietary web
      pages created by businesses and corporations. In this new internet
      landscape, it is now radical to hand-code and self-publish one’s own
      webpage. To argue this point, Carpenter explains how “handmade web pages
      flourished in the mid-to-late-1990s” before the web was taken over by
      commercial ambitions. It used to be common practice for one to handcraft
      their online identity. This is no longer the case because the web has
      become more closed off to the user who must work within limitations beyond
      their control. A small selection of artists and creators are reclaiming
      the freedom of ‘the handmade web’ by manually creating their own webpages
      to challenge the ubiquity of user-based commercialized web reigniting the
      creator-based Web of the past. <br /><br />2. The act of manually creating
      and maintaining one’s own web page is a form of resistance in the current
      commercialized landscape as we approach Web 3.0. This resistance reclaims
      personal agency over one’s creative and expressive capabilities on the
      Internet. Modern web helplessness was recently exemplified in Twitter’s
      transition into X. This was not a democratic choice, the millions of
      Twitter users who had built an archive of their thoughts and lives on the
      website had it drastically changed and were powerless to do anything. The
      handmade web resists this lack of autonomy through the personal creation
      of web pages where profit is not the onus of their creation. The people
      behind TILDE.CLUB and Ubu websites use their knowledge and hardware to
      create spaces that resist the black-box that the web has become, harkening
      back to a more expressive and simpler time. This handmade resistance is
      akin to the handmade world of zines and pamphlets. The labour-intensive
      physical distribution of personal creative works unencumbered by the whims
      of others is what the handmade web seeks to recreate using the world’s
      most sophisticated tool for the dissemination of information. <br /><br />
      3. As a member of Generation Z, I have grown and matured simultaneously
      with the Internet. I have witnessed its widespread adoption first-hand
      which means I have also seen how web pages have changed in order to be
      profitable and universal. When I reflect on the webpages of my youth (or
      look back on documented screenshots) it is easy to see how web pages have
      evolved to lose their personalities. Back when people had control over
      their online identities through services like GeoCites they were
      relatively free to customize their site as they pleased, conveying
      personality through the design, layout, and content of their pages. This
      really isn’t the case anymore. The web is no longer a physical site for
      individuals to build their online identities. It had become a bunch of
      empty, static boxes to fill in. If you don’t like the boxes then too bad.
      It is quite shocking looking back at how incredibly customizable huge
      websites like YouTube used to be. In the transitional period between print
      and web, it seems like web designers focused much more on the physicality
      of webpages. Webpages were designed with the world of physical printing in
      mind. This tactile version of the digital seems to have fallen away in
      recent years which is good for the trees, but more difficult for users to
      engage physically with information disseminated with the Internet.
      Everything is now stuck in a black box. No digital alternative could ever
      beat marking up a page with highlighters or ripping it in half.
