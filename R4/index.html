    <h2>R4: Database as Symbolic Form</h2>
    <p>
      1. Manovich sees database and narrative as two different ways of making
      meaning out of the world. A database presents its contents as an unordered
      list, users must make their way through this information. Narratives see
      ordered cause and effect between events. The experience of exploring a
      database and engaging with a narrative are very different. Artists can
      build experiences of navigating databases to create narratives. I think of
      the modern phenomenon of escape rooms as an example. Players are presented
      with a lot of information all at once, they must assess it and make sense
      of it to gain access to more information in the database. The contents of
      the escape room database and the way players interact with them create an
      interactive narrative. With the proliferation of streaming services like
      Netflix, many households have access to a large database of films. Some of
      these films are their own mini databases that are traversed in a specific
      narrative order based on the inputs of a viewer. These ‘choose your own
      adventure’ experiences are novel, but so far seem too gimmicky to
      supersede traditional narratives where the audience follows one set of
      events and actively connects to it. One computer game that innovates the
      blend of database and narrative (as described by Manovich) is Sam Barlow’s
      Immortality (2022). The experience starts by presenting the player with a
      piece of film footage, the viewer can scrub through and pause the clip.
      They can click on details in the clip like a film slate, a cup, text, or a
      person's face like visual hyperlinks. Once clicked the game will provide
      you with another clip where that detail also appears. This discovery
      process will slowly provide the player with a database of over 10 hours of
      footage. By exploring this database the viewer can uncover the secret
      behind the disappearance of a fictional actress. This narrative agency
      keeps the player very engaged as they trail their own path through the
      data. <br /><br />
      2. In the 19 years since Manovich published this paper, a lot has changed.
      The databases presented in the paper seem quaint by today’s standards. His
      predictions about the continuing proliferation of databases as an
      important symbolic form have come true, but in an altered form. The way
      databases are presented to viewers has evolved. Content, especially on
      social media is presented as an infinite scroll. This large collection of
      data is presented, with very little active work by the viewer. Algorithms
      find and present a page of content that never ends. Manovich could not
      have foreseen the detrimental impacts of such a convenient way of
      exploring a database. Aza Raskin, the inventor of the infinite scroll has
      publicly apologized for his invention and the vast amounts of damage it
      has caused. Raskin claims that his invention wastes 200,000 human
      lifetimes every day. Manovich accurately argued for the ubiquity of the
      database as the primary form of the modern age, but he was not able to
      predict how databases work together and use algorithms to become personal
      to each user. These algorithmically curated databases are everywhere and
      have quite a hold on current society, for better (convenience,
      entertainment) and for worse (mental health challenges, attention loss,
      echo chambers, and unproductivity). When each individual has access to
      multiple narratives that are constructed just for them filled with
      seemingly endless content it makes it far more difficult to connect. The
      postmodern world is losing its large narratives that connect large
      populations (i.e. religion), things are much more personal and isolating.
      As philosopher Jean Baudrillard observes, postmodern society is like a
      freeway, our lack of familiarity with common ideas separates people who
      come into our lives and then subsequently leave. There is no room for
      connection because we are each living in completely different worlds.

      3. Manovich’s writing changed my perspective on the importance of the
      database as a symbolic form. Before reading I would have argued against
      it, but now I understand and hope to incorporate this newfound
      understanding in my index project. As Maniovich describes, I want to take
      the user on a journey with my index. The ways one navigates a database can
      alter their perceptions of its contents. I hope to make my index
      interactive and playful (like much of my other work). The order of the
      contents of the database will give it significant meaning. By exploring my
      work, the user will hopefully be able to see my progression as I become
      more comfortable with the skills learned in class. Originally my index was
      going to be similar to how Manovich describes cinema, with only one screen
      presented at a time. Now, I hope to present the user with the data in an
      ongoing interactive manner (using my newfound knowledge of JQuery
      interactions like click, drag, and scroll). Meaning will be found not only
      in the content but also in how one interacts with it and how it is
      presented in relation to the other content.
